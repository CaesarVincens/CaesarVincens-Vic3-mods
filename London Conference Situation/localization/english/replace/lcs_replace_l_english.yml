 treaty_of_london_events.2.f: ""So now the Dutch desire arbitration? No doubt they have their eyes firmly fixed on rightful Belgian soil. Though their ambition lie bare for all to see, we may have little choice in the matter. A refusal to compromise might harm our standing in Europe in ways we cannot easily amend.""
 treaty_of_london_events.2.a: "Very well, agree to great power mediation."

 treaty_of_london_events.3.f: ""For nearly a decade we have sought to bring these two parts to the table, and for nearly a decade we have been frustrated in our efforts.

 treaty_of_london_events.5.f: "As the delegations made their way out of the Foreign Office and onto King Charles Street, the air of amicability that they so deperately tried to maintain could not even fool the doorman — much less each other. What this would mean for future Dutch-Belgian relations they could still not say, but that it would be bad? Now at last, there was something they could agree on."
